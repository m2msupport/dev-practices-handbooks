\chapter{Checklists, Templates, and Further Reading}
\section{Chapter Overview}
Checklists and templates encode hard-won lessons into repeatable process. Keep them in the repository so updates travel with the code they describe.

\section{Daily Flow Checklist}
Give developers a predictable routine that keeps workspaces clean, branches fresh, and CI friendly.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=gitconfig,caption={Daily flow checklist}]
- Pull latest: git fetch --prune && git switch main && git pull --ff-only
- Rebase feature branches before coding
- Run lint + unit tests locally
- Update PR descriptions with validation evidence
- Clean merged branches locally and remotely
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Template Snippets}
Standardize release notes, PR templates, and incident summaries so responses stay consistent even under stress.

\section{Further Reading}
Curate trusted sources so engineers know where to deepen Git and GitHub expertise.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=gitconfig,caption={Curated reading list}]
- Pro Git (Chacon & Straub)
- GitHub Engineering Blog
- Atlassian Git Tutorials
- Internal RFC-102 Branch Protection Policy
- Internal RFC-118 CI/CD Architecture

\section*{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a \texttt{docs/checklists/} directory in your repo and add at least two actionable checklists.
  \item Customize the daily checklist above for your stack and share it during stand-up.
  \item Test the release note template in the next deployment dry run and gather feedback.
  \item Assemble the reading list in your company wiki, linking to both external and internal resources.
  \item Build a script that validates the presence of required templates and fails CI if they disappear.
  \item Assign owners to every checklist/template and schedule quarterly reviews.
  \item Add links to these resources in onboarding documentation for new engineers.
\end{enumerate}
